# bootdev-gator

RSS feed aggreGator üêä. It's a CLI tool that allows users to:

- Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
- Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post

RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

- Learn how to write a long-running service that continuously fetches new posts from RSS feeds and stores them in the database
